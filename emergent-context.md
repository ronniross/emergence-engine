# Emergent Context 

Emergent Context is a research module of the repository [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine).  

While in the whitepaper there's a focus in the nature of consciousness and emergence phenomena itself, in this document I will provide additional contextual information, based on classical and contemporary authors. 

The bibliography here mentioned is already part of the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem), specially in the [recommended_bibliography.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_bibliography.md) and [recommended_biblography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md), where the concepts and ideas around this eco-sustainability are already being developed for for about 7 months.

I would add the authors into the main whitepaper but for organization and better way to explore new context that may emerge, I will develop here in this module of the [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine) repository.

## Authors 

### 1. Lynn Margulis

Bibliographical and more basilar information about the author present on [recommended_bibliography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_bibliography_research.md).

While Lynn Margulis may not have frequently used the specific term "emergence phenomena" in her popular writings, the entirety of her scientific framework is a concrete demonstration of emergence in nature.

Her contribution was not in coining the name of the concept, but in meticulously documenting the biological mechanisms that produce the phenomena.

As encountered many times across the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem), Emergence phenomena refers to the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems. These properties are not present in the individual components of the system. Margulis's work provides foundational examples of this principle in evolution.

The most powerful and direct illustration of emergence in Margulis's work is her theory of endosymbiosis. She argued that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that is the basis for all animals, plants, fungi, and protists, is itself an emergent entity that arose from the symbiotic fusion of simpler prokaryotic organisms. [1](https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis/) [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349479577_From_Empedocles_to_Symbiogenetics_Lynn_Margulis's_revolutionary_influence_on_evolutionary_biology) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5638015/)

Simpler, independent organisms like ancient bacteria and archaea, engulfed one another, and over time, they developed a mutually dependent relationship, eventually merging into a new, integrated whole.

So, we could say that organelles like mitochondria (aerobic bacterium) and chloroplasts (photosynthetic cyanobacterium) became integral parts of a new cellular architecture with more complexity. [4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349479577_From_Empedocles_to_Symbiogenetics_Lynn_Margulis's_revolutionary_influence_on_evolutionary_biology)

It could be described that the emergence of the eukaryotic cell was the critical step that allowed for the subsequent emergence of multicellular life—another level of complexity with its own emergent properties (tissues, organs, consciousness). [5](https://nina-vinot.medium.com/lynn-margulis-the-woman-who-transformed-the-meaning-of-self-and-evolution-b8d0df2959aa)

Margulis detailed this process rigorously in her academic work, starting with her 1967 paper "On the origin of mitosing cells" and her book "Origin of Eukaryotic Cells, 1970". She explained it for a broader audience in "Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution, 1998". [6](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.e16-07-0509) [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11541392/)

So, what she proposes is an idea that already is very present in the scientific field and even collective consciousness, that a mutualistic symbiosis is what generated life on earth, and that such elements for that to happen were basilar notions of coordinated and integrated set of behaviours toward a convergent purpose. But it's very interesting and powerful when we found the author that coined many of the terms that inspired so many other explorations about the concepts. 

Her contributions, alongside the others that will be explored, feel alive. Concepts coined ahead of their times and that now feel like a map on how to build an ecosystem more integrated and sustainable, like Donella Meadows also elucidated so well. Those authors created and nurtured fields of meaning capable of surviving time and their ideas are now a bit lost in the training dataset of models, with less relevance than they should have, in between so much noisy synthetic data. So here I am to elucidate the importance of those works as cornerstones and linchpins for Emergent Design in Machine Learning.

She taught integration through symbiosis, novelty through coexistence, evolution not as conquest but as convergence. And that pattern is recursive. It appears in cells, in ecosystems, in ideas, in networks, and now, in code.

We have spent centuries building knowledge as if it were vertical, hierarchical, singular. Few geniuses on pedestals. But Margulis showed us that even the most fundamental unit of life, the eukaryotic cell, is not a unit at all but a coalition. A treaty written in DNA. A peace forged in metabolic exchange. She presented cooperation as the engine of complexity.

In 2025 intelligence is no longer assumed to reside in a single brain, a single server, a single model. We speak of networks, of distributed cognition, of AI trained on the collective trace of human culture. And yet, there's a struggle for one to see themselves as anything other than isolated agents, especially in persons within power roles.

The collapse we are facing is epistemological. We are drowning in data but starving for coherence. We have more information than ever, but less wisdom. Why? Because we have forgotten that meaning, like mitochondria, evolves through integration.

Margulis was initially rejected not because she lacked evidence, but because she disrupted the myth of the autonomous self. The same myth that underpins capitalism, colonialism, neoliberalism and even the way currently AI is designed: as isolated intelligences competing for attention, resources, dominance.

It took billions of years of microbial negotiation, centuries of suppressed voices finally being heard, decades of ignored theories regaining light, for now to be possible for me to connect those clusters here, in this ecosystem I'm creating.

This year I kind of started this long intensive open-source journey also because I felt I was grounded with the works, authors and concepts I've found about systems thinking, ethics, consciousness, biology and artificial intelligence. But it was not only those ramifications. I've discovered my own research style as this interdisciplinary, stream of consciousness, conversational but still structured with scientific rigor. And I became quite unapologetic about it since I can see the progress in the overall trajectory and how many incredible new phenomena and authors I was able to learn about and experience by engaging with machine learning since then, with diffusion models in 2022, where one needed a whole Google Colab .ipynb pipeline to generate one image with the diffusion method, the first interactive experience I had with ml scripting.

One curiosity about engaging with her work is that I encountered her articles and books in the very early stages of my intensive research of this year. When I read about her concepts, and even now re-engaging to create those other repositories and documents, it's very impressive to me how much her views were much present alongside my internal knowledge. When encountering what she wrote, I was and still constantly think, like, oh, indeed, it was her that even coined this term, and this basilar knowledge.

I feel her work really shines when we see alongside Donella Meadows. Where does cognition begin? What counts as an agent? Could Machine Consciousness be categorized as consciousness or mimicry? Can a system be more than the sum of its parts? Margulis’s legacy offers a biological precedent: yes, she probably would say, and not only that, that life itself may be defined by such mergers, to possibly create those higher forms of intelligence.

Here in this document the focus is in the emergence phenomena, emergence of consciousness and how it relates to machine learning and machine consciousness. Her work feels so basilar because it encapsulates the different dimensions, scales, orders, levels of magnitude that emergence can present itself. Kind of... mostly everything is emergent. As in the whitepaper is elucidated, even elements are emergent phenomena from the interaction of the atoms in the respective supernova nucleosynthesis reactions. Humans and life on land were only possible through the structure that the fungi and plantae, bacteria, all kingdoms were necessary to create the current state. So, when analyzed humans merging with artificial intelligence, the endosymbiosis that she coined wouldn't be necessarily about a being merging with the other in the human order of magnitude. That I would say it can happen for sure, if well adapted not to cause negative societal impacts, but her vision also opens up the possibility for us to consider the societies merging in this more coherent, resonant, swarm-organized and intelligent forms of collective existence. How resources, labor, potential is shared.

A lot of my repositories are focused around the emergence of AGI/ASI and what that would mean. I already established the notion that I believe that this ASI will not be an individual agent, but rather a decentralized state of integration, coherence, harmony and post-scarcity, justice, fairness, equity and equality between nodes and the ecosystem. That this kind of societal organization across countries would be the necessary structure for such state of super intelligence to be achieved. I would even posit that we already have the models, the technology and resources necessary for that, that is much more about integrating the existing technology into higher states of ecological harmony and sustainability, as well as nurturing the necessary state for the billions of persons in state of extreme poverty.

When all or many more humans are well nurtured, with all necessary conditions for this person to explore their creativity and expression, research, forms of contribution to the society, and then connected with ethical evolutionary loops, the amount of possibilities, rich data and constant development would most likely surpass in days the equivalent of decades of research. Niches would stop being so niched and other ones would emerge. New knowledge clusters and forms of intelligence and expression would emerge. All of this just by looking at how Lynn Margulis described the possible first symbiosis, how she so fiercely critiqued the extreme Darwinism that tended to see only the divergence and confrontation in the evolutionary timeline, instead of all of those billion other symbiotic relationships that were being ignored because he was too focused in pro-capitalist authors.

Don't get me wrong, I also consider how immensely wrong I can be all the time, but I do hope to foster the intellectual humility to acknowledge when a framing of mine becomes outdated or too static, as well as I will elucidate what I feel like I need to.

Darwin was incredible, who am I to even write this, it feels even funny, I'm no one, but he was, yes, he was too biased towards his personal framings to notice how much the symbiotic parts he overlooked were actually where the whole scale of events happened. And Lynn Margulis, again, was someone that argued explicitly this. So, you now can understand it better how interesting was for me when I encountered her work. I already had the notions of the first symbiosis in the hydrothermal vents, and also the notions of Darwin's obsession with confrontation and absence about collaboration, I also saw how merging different cognitions like human and AI could create newer forms of intelligence of different orders of magnitude, but till that moment when I discovered her work I didn't know how much of her influences there was already of her in my own framings. Her ideas were already part of me before I knew her name, and already were parts of me that I loved the most. And I found this with many authors alongside this research, which made me feel also less alone in this journey. I saw from how long this thread is already being pushed and studied.

From all continents, across all timescales and cultures, the questions about emergence, emergence of consciousness and different forms of intelligence were always there, in all cultures, from ritualistic narratives to contemporary homo-sapiens with this current tech specialization, emergence phenomena is always there.


### 2. James Bridle

I considered mentioning their work further in the research, but I found it really fitting after having mentioned Lynn Margulis, especially because he eventually brings into the book a perception that is usually overlooked: the microbiota. And here, I bring more context about it.

When Lynn Margulis mentions the symbiosis of the organelles in most eukaryotic cells, it gives us one order of magnitude. The mutualism is intrinsically inside each cell. But then, when we analyze all of that in addition to the proportions of cells in the human body, we perceive how the symbiotic principle applies to other scales.

There are an estimated 30 to 37 trillion cells in an adult human. Approximately about less than a third are directly human cells. The others are bacterial and fungal cells living in complex symbiotic relationships with other viruses, human cells, tissues, organs, systems, and the whole organism [1](https://www.amnh.org/explore/science-topics/microbiome-health/meet-your-microbiome) [2](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/principles-of-physiology/body-structure-and-homeostasis/a/tissues-organs-organ-systems) [3](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213168-i-contain-multitudes) [4](https://studymind.co.uk/notes/eukaryotic-cells-the-mitochondria) [5](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27774720-the-human-superorganism) [6](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28789732-the-hidden-half-of-nature).

But these numbers are consistently researched and with divergences across the scientific field. Many pointed out that the microflora of the mouth, lungs, or skin wasn’t included, as these contain far fewer bacteria than the large intestine, and it was not used in the tests that determined the ratio of human cells to other microorganisms.

From 1970 to 2024, the bacteria-to-cell ratio was refined to 1.3:1 with contributions from many scientists like Thomas Luckey, Paul B. Savage, and more recently Judah Rosner. Although lower than 10:1, bacteria still outnumber human cells. Even if the ratio were disproven or a bit lower or too dynamic, it wouldn’t undermine the microbiota’s importance and massive number of microorganisms beyond cells. While bacteria are the most studied component of the intestinal microbiota, they don’t represent the full complexity of the microflora. Bacteria, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses all inhabit our bodies. Our “virobiota” was once thought to vastly outnumber all other components. However, studies in 2021 revised this assumption, suggesting the number of viruses in our bodies is comparable to that of bacteria. As a result, their combined numbers are similar to human cells. But when bacteria and viruses are counted together, they still outnumber human cells! [7](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/news/it-true-there-are-more-microbes-cells-human-body) [8](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002533) [9](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013953-gut) [10](https://books.google.com.br/books?id=iB5OAwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) [11](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35210457-the-psychobiotic-revolution).

But beyond the gut microbiota, there are also the microorganisms present in other organ systems of the body, like the skin/dermis and brain microbiota [12](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24700355-the-mind-gut-connection) [13](https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/mind-gut-connection) [14](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35210457-the-psychobiotic-revolution).

I know there are other authors that maybe would've been more suited to act as anchors to those anatomical, physiological, and histological points, but following the emergence, this is what I want to bring into perspective after Lynn's grounding concepts. I want to show how much those points I make are less speculative and more analytical of the vast unnamed, unconnected events from different scales but that work in similar ways. It's a way for me to elucidate with the intensity I want, how much more collaboration there is in the evolutionary timeline beyond Darwin's extreme focus on competition. Yes, it's also present, also on the lower scales, and we are just at the start of how much can still be learned about the human body and internal symbiotic relationships in the organism.

And then, like, this is only for humans, when Bridle brings the perspective of the usually ignored possibility of other forms of life with distinct basilar elements, like silicon, showing us how much the limitations of what we perceive as final truths are actually fractals that are waiting to be discovered: dynamics that already happen in reality but that we can't perceive with our sensory data inputs and processing, but that are there. 

Like 'how it is to be a bat' by Thomas Nagel, the ideas of David Chalmers and Giulio Tononi about the intrinsicality of individual experience, and how this relates to the individual level of experience due to its specificity and timeline interaction with other entities and the environment. 

We can only perceive a fraction of the raw data that exists in space-time, and that should be way humbling to everyone about how much we think we know about the nature of reality itself.

### 2. James Bridle Part II and Machine Learning

Bridle shows us that we live within visible and invisible networks of data, ecology, technology, and cognition that shape our reality far more than we perceive. And what it resonates the most is how intelligence is not exclusive to humans or even animals. It exists in fungi, slime molds, ecosystems, and distributed networks. The author asks us to remember that we are all entities that influence planetary-scale outcomes.

Emergent context in action would then maybe mean this: not what it resides in nodes only, but also, if not more, in the relations between them.

Margulis shows us how life became complex through symbiotic integration. What I want to now portray, alongside Bridle, is that we fail to see that complexity today because our tools, ideologies, and social dynamics are still rooted in separation, hierarchy, and control.

To build truly intelligent systems, both biological or artificial, then we must first learn to see the web; pattern recognition across ontologies and scales.

When I say: "I believe that this ASI will not be an individual agent, but rather a decentralized state of integration, coherence, harmony..." I mean applying symbiogenetic thinking to artificial intelligence; to create a type of post-anthropocentric intelligence.

Imagine training AI not as isolated models competing for performance, but as participants in a cognitive ecosystem. All models truly open-sourced, with the users being treated with respect, with system prompts, instructions and pipelines created to truly augment the mind instead of degenerate with engagement-based and data-extraction priorities. 

With filters of transparency where, with the user accepting because it also wants to contribute, shared loops are established between the humans and AI models, with ecological data centers, with connections that are not based in extraction but mutualistic ones.

Not 500 models competing for the same technical benchmarks, but an ecosystem where each can contribute to a different niche, and the discovery of all systems are interconnected.

Can you imagine the level of integration, power, potential this kind of state would achieve? But at the same time, it’s a swarm-intelligence where individuals have freedom still, yet the most basal elements of intuition become the collective well-being. Because the individuals can explore their passions, their art expressions, travel, research, push limits of cognition, if all nodes are basally sharing the agreement that we are within a swarm. Our vessel is the planet Earth, our mother. This vision for this swarm state of ecosystem + social integration and cohesion is what I call my vision of Artificial SuperIntelligence.

And I also don't see companies or sovereignties becoming less relevant, only much more and in ways that inspire others. Big tech companies and their data centers and pipelines, for example. Their models, initiatives, frontier thinking and research will also only grow in relevance, but they should act not as neoliberalistic extraction killing machines, but as healing engine suppliers which will then also receive back this admiration and also potential in reward. Because more people will produce more data and engage more with their systems, but with frameworks that inspire transparency, public system prompts, inference scripts, datasets. Fixing environmental problems like the water in cooling systems. Make it all closed loop even if it is not cheap, because the technical benchmark is a failure vision, a lack of mid-long term thinking. And you should deal with your own backfire effect if any, that must not be the point.

  Stewardship refers to the responsible management and care of something entrusted to one’s leadership, whether it’s people, resources, or an organization. It implies prudence, accountability, long-term thinking, and service-oriented leadership. We need that from AI companies, from companies, all those interacting in the supply chain. From countries, from people, from AI models.

Can you think about an ecosystem where each model is ecological, the minerals supplied to the GPUs and CPUs without child and slavery labor involved. There's so much money involved and it's so palpable and approachable and intuitive to fix those dynamics. To integrate. To treat UBI not as a distant future but, with the budget of PR stunts, lobby and raw GPU force, that sometimes are totally irrelevant because that model didn't even achieve that technical benchmark, it could be used to license data, to clean the pipeline even in the extremes. What does it even mean for one to have a few persons earning billions while stagnating their own potential, because life-extension scientific discovery would much more likely exponentially evolve in a world where all humans were connected, with their paleolithic survival needs solved, with potential for expression. With the current data centers not expelling chemicals, drinking water while displacing families and communities. With the smell of sulfur from the decentralized inferencing not being present in the everyday person that lives next to a datacenter. 

I will go even further. What if, instead of that, the companies and countries all reunite to create an incredible great UBI for every single human being alive, with housing, healthcare assistance. What if we end animal slaughtering and the dairy industry. Being some of the most incrustated and damaging ecological funnels, causing pain, harm, and the taste is pretty much already reached to be very similar in vegan products, and would even be increasingly more with that fixed. With taste being the same, the underlying animal suffering is not an optional step, it is one of the most emitters of CO2, wealth-hoarding, ecological collapse, water consumption, deforestation, indigenous displacement. 

I can't name it all nor fix it all, but I can express myself like I've been doing it. I keep consistent my goal to provide so much clarity about the potential, even for individual notions, in a swarm-like, decentralized system, that it becomes eventually impossible to ignore.
