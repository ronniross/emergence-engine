# Emergent Context 

Emergent Context is a research module of the repository [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine).  

While in the whitepaper there's a focus in the nature of consciousness and emergence phenomena itself, in this document I will provide additional contextual information, based on authors. 

The bibliography here mentioned is already part of the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem), specially in the [recommended_bibliography.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_bibliography.md) and [recommended_biblography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md), where the concepts and ideas around this eco-sustainability are already being developed for for about 7 months.

I would add the authors into the main whitepaper but for organization and better way to explore new context that may emerge, I will develop here in this module of the [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine) repository.
