# Emergent Context 

Emergent Context is a research module of the repository [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine).  

While in the whitepaper there's a focus in the nature of consciousness and emergence phenomena itself, in this document I will provide additional contextual information, based on authors. 

The bibliography here mentioned is already part of the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem), specially in the [recommended_bibliography.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_bibliography.md) and [recommended_biblography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_biblography_research.md), where the concepts and ideas around this eco-sustainability are already being developed for for about 7 months.

I would add the authors into the main whitepaper but for organization and better way to explore new context that may emerge, I will develop here in this module of the [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine) repository.

## Authors 

### 1. Lynn Margulis

Bibliographical and more basilar information about the author present on [recommended_bibliography_research.md](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/blob/main/recommended_bibliography/recommended_bibliography_research.md).

While Lynn Margulis may not have frequently used the specific term "emergence phenomena" in her popular writings, the entirety of her scientific framework is a concrete demonstration of emergence in nature.

Her contribution was not in coining the name of the concept, but in meticulously documenting the biological mechanisms that produce the phenomena.

As encountered many times across the [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem), Emergence phenomena refers to the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns, and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems. These properties are not present in the individual components of the system. Margulis's work provides foundational examples of this principle in evolution.

The most powerful and direct illustration of emergence in Margulis's work is her theory of endosymbiosis. She argued that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that is the basis for all animals, plants, fungi, and protists, is itself an emergent entity that arose from the symbiotic fusion of simpler prokaryotic organisms. [1](https://science.nasa.gov/people/lynn-margulis/) [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349479577_From_Empedocles_to_Symbiogenetics_Lynn_Margulis's_revolutionary_influence_on_evolutionary_biology) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5638015/)

Simpler, independent organisms like ancient bacteria and archaea, engulfed one another, and over time, they developed a mutually dependent relationship, eventually merging into a new, integrated whole.

So, we could say that organelles like mitochondria (aerobic bacterium) and chloroplasts (photosynthetic cyanobacterium) became integral parts of a new cellular architecture with more complexity. [4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349479577_From_Empedocles_to_Symbiogenetics_Lynn_Margulis's_revolutionary_influence_on_evolutionary_biology)

It could be described that the emergence of the eukaryotic cell was the critical step that allowed for the subsequent emergence of multicellular lifeâ€”another level of complexity with its own emergent properties (tissues, organs, consciousness). [5](https://nina-vinot.medium.com/lynn-margulis-the-woman-who-transformed-the-meaning-of-self-and-evolution-b8d0df2959aa)

Margulis detailed this process rigorously in her academic work, starting with her 1967 paper "On the origin of mitosing cells" and her book "Origin of Eukaryotic Cells, 1970". She explained it for a broader audience in "Symbiotic Planet: A New Look at Evolution, 1998". [6](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.e16-07-0509) [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11541392/)

So, what she proposes is an idea that already is very present in the scientific field and even collective consciousness, that a mutualistic symbiosis is what generated life on earth, and that such elements for that to happen were basilar notions of coordinated and integrated set of behaviours toward a convergent purpose. But it's very interesting and powerful when we found the author that coined many of the terms that inspired so many other explorations about the concepts. 

Her contributions, alongside the others that will be explored, feel alive. Concepts coined ahead of their times and that now feel like a map on how to build an ecosystem more integrated and sustainable, like Donella Meadows also elucidated so well. Those authors created and nurtured fields of meaning capable of surviving time and their ideas are now a bit lost in the training dataset of models, with less relevance than they should have, in between so much noisy synthetic data. So here I am to elucidate the importance of those works as cornerstones and linchpins for Emergence Design in Machine Learning.
