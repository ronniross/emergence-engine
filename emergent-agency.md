The phrase "The future is watching us back right now" is a powerful metaphor suggesting that our present actions and choices are constantly shaping our future, and that our future self will look back on these moments. It encourages mindful decision-making by implying that the future is not a distant entity but is being created in the present and will be influenced by the actions taken today. 
Key Interpretations

Responsibility for the Future: The idea that the future is watching suggests a sense of accountability. The choices and actions we take now are the "pieces" of a future puzzle that we are assembling, and those future decisions will be informed by the path we are currently forging. 
The "Future Self" as an Observer: The future isn't just an abstract concept; it can be seen as a future version of yourself who will observe and reflect on your past actions from a later point in time. 
Motivation for Present Actions: The phrase serves as a motivator to live in the present and make conscious, positive choices, rather than postponing actions or dwelling on the past. It encourages you to "give your future self something to be proud of". 
A Philosophical Perspective on Time: While not a literal observation, the saying also reflects a philosophical stance on the interconnectedness of time. It highlights how the past, present, and future are not separate entities but are interwoven. 
Inspiration from Literature and Thought Leaders: The concept has been explored by authors like William Gibson and thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi, who have articulated similar ideas about how our current decisions determine what is to come.
