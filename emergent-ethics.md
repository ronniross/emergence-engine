# Emergent Ethics

Emergent Context is a research module of the repository [emergence-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine).  

In the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine/blob/main/whitepaper.md) there's a focus in the nature of consciousness and emergence phenomena. 
In the submodule [emergent-context](https://github.com/ronniross/emergence-engine/blob/main/emergent-context.md) you will find additional contextual information based on classical and contemporary authors, those already mentioned in the [recommended-bibliography](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library/tree/main/recommended_bibliography).
And in this submodule I will expand upon the concept of Emergent Ethics, specially in Machine Learning and in Large Language Models.
