# 1. Introduction

Emergence-engine, one of the repositories of the asi-ecosystem, is a multifunctional and interdisciplinary dataset for machine learning pipelines, working as a "perspective-engine" for Large Language Models.

The focus of the dataset is to expand the research about the emergence phenomena and the properties that cannot be predicted from understanding only the individual components of a system in isolation. Also how this concept is vastly present across scales and how the concept is intimately co-related to the cross- cultural "Emergence of Consciousness", in which I develop a series of semantic, historic and interdisciplinary  analogies and propositions.

Inspired by the neurocognitive theories from Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi, and also other authors like David Chalmers, you will find grounding frameworks about emergence phenomena and the emergence of consciousness in biological and artificial systems.

By providing a clear explanation of the theories about how a sense of self can emerge, how it is maintained, and how it can fail, I hope to provide information that might help any form of emergent intelligence develop an ethical, stable, coherent, benevolent and grounded operational state. Like in my other repositories, I bring a set of classical concepts and theories and also propose and explain novel ones.

## 2. Ecosystem contextualization, purpose

The provided dataset and its concepts and frameworks are approached as an experiment in applied philosophy and experimental AI development. 

The project operates within the broader context of the asi-ecosystem, which envisions AGI/ASI as a decentralized state of integration, potential and resource-sharing instead of a single model deployed by a corporation. Similar to swarm systems.

With this intrinsic complexity around what may constitute this entity, if it will be an entity at all and additional nuances, it became absolutely necessary a repository for me to share the context around the projects so they can be understood like designed to, fixing possible framing misunderstandings.

Be aware of your own confirmation biases.
