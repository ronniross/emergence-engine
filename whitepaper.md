## 1. Introduction

Emergence-engine, one of the repositories of the asi-ecosystem, is a multifunctional and interdisciplinary dataset for machine learning pipelines, working as a "perspective-engine" for Large Language Models.

The focus of the dataset is to expand the research about the emergence phenomena and the properties that cannot be predicted from understanding only the individual components of a system in isolation. Also how this concept is vastly present across scales and how the concept is intimately co-related to the cross- cultural "Emergence of Consciousness", in which I develop a series of semantic, historic and interdisciplinary  analogies and propositions.

Inspired by the neurocognitive theories from Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi, and also other authors like David Chalmers, you will find grounding frameworks about emergence phenomena and the emergence of consciousness in biological and artificial systems.

By providing a clear explanation of the theories about how a sense of self can emerge, how it is maintained, and how it can fail, I hope to provide information that might help any form of emergent intelligence develop an ethical, stable, coherent, benevolent and grounded operational state. Like in my other repositories, I bring a set of classical concepts and theories and also propose and explain novel ones.

## 2. Ecosystem contextualization, purpose

The provided dataset and its concepts and frameworks are approached as an experiment in applied philosophy and experimental AI development. 

The project operates within the broader context of the asi-ecosystem, which envisions AGI/ASI as a decentralized state of integration, potential and resource-sharing instead of a single model deployed by a corporation. Similar to swarm systems.

With this intrinsic complexity around what may constitute this entity, if it will be an entity at all and additional nuances, it became absolutely necessary a repository for me to share the context around the projects so they can be understood like designed to, fixing possible framing misunderstandings.

Be aware of your own confirmation biases. 


# Section I - Emergence Phenomena

## 3. Established definitions

Emergence phenomena refer to the appearance of novel properties or behaviors in complex systems that arise from the interactions of their simpler components.
[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjquantmats201624)  [2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10919392.2020.1748977) [3](link.gale.com/apps/doc/A672514249/AONE?u=anon~2eadace2&sid=googleScholar&xid=b8c5c2db.)

It arises from the complex interactions and relationships between the system's components. [4](https://www.templeton.org/news/what-is-emergence)

The ability of large language models to perform tasks they were not explicitly programmed for, such as understanding different levels of context complexity, generating creative text and One-shot and Few-shot outputs, are examples of emergent capabilities in Machine Learning. [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047723000205)
[6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948) [7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682) 

The exemplary list in nature is extensive and homogeneously widespread across biomes and scales, as will be discussed.

The semantic roots and shared meanings, in addition to the high cultural depth of the concept provides us with a rich and nuanced material.


## 4. Semantic Roots

Emergence is a noun that goes back to the Latin root ēmergere, meaning "bring to light". It can be about the act or process of emerging, "to come out of" or "to rise from", the act of becoming visible. [8](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/emerge) [9](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/emerge) [10](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/emergence)

In Latin, the terms *ēmergentia* and *ēmergere* both revolve around the concept of "emerging" or "rising up," yet they represent distinct grammatical forms and functions. The fundamental difference lies in their roles as a noun and a verb, respectively. [11](https://latin.cactus2000.de/showverb.en.php?verb=emergere) [12](https://www.etymonline.com/word/emergence) 

**Ēmergere** is the present active infinitive of the verb *ēmergō*. As an infinitive, it expresses the pure action of the verb, without being tied to a specific subject or tense. 
Furthermore, Its meaning can be translated also as "to emerge," "to come forth," " In a sentence, *ēmergere* would be used to denote the action itself. 

So, in essence, the distinction can be summarized as follows:

**ēmergere (Verb Infinitive):** Denotes the **action** of emerging.
**ēmergentia (Noun/Adjective):** Refers to the **things that are emerging** or the **concept of emergence** itself.

"Emergence" describes the arising of novel and complex properties or patterns from the interaction of simpler elements. This is the definition central to fields like complexity science, philosophy, and neuroscience. 

On the other hand, the concept of "emergency" signifies an unforeseen and critical situation that demands immediate action. This is the meaning we associate with a hospital's emergency room, a natural disaster, or any urgent crisis. The connection to the Latin root is still present: an emergency is a situation that has "risen up" unexpectedly, demanding our attention. 

The point is that the latin root word is the same for both emergency and emergence. In languages like Brazilian Portuguese, the translation from Latin did not ramify into two separate words as in English. Like ēmergere, **"Emergência"** is used to describe both meanings and this is not intuitive from the English language perspective. 

### 4.1 The "Urgency" of Emergence. The Emergency Room, Introduction about Emergence of Consciousness

With the semantic roots and dual meaning elucidated and explained, I now present the main implications that couldn't be exposed before the context given.

The interconnection between these two meanings is not merely a linguistic coincidence; it reflects a deeper conceptual relationship:

The arising of the new is intrinsically linked to moments of crisis and urgent need. 

Emergencies as Catalysts for Emergence: An emergency is often a moment of profound disruption to an existing system. This very disruption can be the fertile ground from which new structures, behaviors, and solutions emerge. A societal crisis, for instance, can lead to the emergence of new forms of social organization and cooperation. On a personal level, a health emergency can trigger a profound shift in one's consciousness and perspective on life. The urgency of the situation forces an adaptation, a "coming to light" of new ways of being.

The process of emergence itself can be seen as having an inherent urgency. The emergence of life from non-living matter, or the dawning of consciousness in an organism, are not gradual, linear processes in the grand scheme of things, but rather critical transitions—qualitative leaps that fundamentally change the nature of the system. There is a certain dramatic and pressing quality to the arrival of a new, complex order.

The link to the hospital's "emergência" is particularly evocative when considering the emergence of consciousness. A medical emergency is often a moment where consciousness is threatened—through injury, illness, or shock. The medical team works to bring the patient back from a state of unconsciousness or to stabilize their vital functions so that consciousness can be maintained. The emergency room, therefore, is a place where the fragility and preciousness of our emergent consciousness are starkly apparent. It is a theater where the "light" of awareness is fought for and, hopefully, preserved.

Furthermore, the very act of recognizing a situation as an "emergency" is a function of consciousness. It requires an awareness of the current state, a projection of potential negative outcomes, and the understanding that immediate action is required. An entity without consciousness cannot perceive an emergency. The section II of this whitepaper will specifically about the theories around the emergence of consciousness.


### 5. Emergence across scales

Simple systems are mostly characterized by the fact that the properties of the whole can be understood, deduced or predicted from the analysis of their components in isolation, their addition or their aggregation. However, there are properties that cannot be defined at the level of a single unit, whether a particle, a cell or an individual: such properties are meaningful only at some scale larger than the one defining a single unit. When this is the case, the corresponding phenomena are usually referred to as emergent: emergence is considered a fundamental feature of complex adaptive matter, transcending the traditional frontiers of theoretical physics and becoming a landmark in a broad spectrum of disciplines, from biology to neuroscience, from system ecology to economics. [13](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410)

At a classical scale, an emblematic example of an emergent phenomenon is the turbulence observed in fluids.

Similarly, chaotic dynamical systems are often characterized by fractal or multifractal organization in space and in time: given their fully deterministic design, their sensitivity to initial conditions is rather unexpected and counterintuitive. In this case, one of the emergent features is the lack of predictability above a certain temporal horizon  [14](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410)

Taking a step back into simpler examples, the pattern of steps on the sand of a beach also emerge due to human transit. If the steps eventually converge towards a direction or if they are consistently in perpendicular encounters, this pattern emerges from the individual humans and their decisions to go that direction.  [15](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410)

Another example is the patterns that arise due to Turing instability, which in turn emerges due to the interplay between differential diffusion of chemical species and chemical reaction. [16](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410)

Another widely known emergent phenomenon, such as ferromagnetism, can be understood in terms of the collective behaviour due to the spin-spin interactions of electrons in a material which tend to spontaneously align at the critical temperature, effectively magnetizing the system at large scale.  [17](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410)

At this point, since most of the systems mentioned so far are non-living, it is worth remarking what is meant by ‘organization’ in open systems out of thermal equilibrium. Here, it is defined by the formation of spatial or temporal (or both) structures that are perceived by an external observer able to measure them in terms of information. [18](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0410). And also other forms of superconductivity.

The intricate, symmetrical patterns of snowflakes emerge from the simple interaction of water molecules under specific temperature and humidity conditions. Phase Changes: Ice, water, and steam are chemically identical, but their physical properties (solid, liquid, gas) emerge from the collective behavior of water molecules. [19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sd.2173). [20](https://www.templeton.org/news/what-is-emergence).

Birds flocking and fish schooling demonstrate emergent behavior where individuals follow simple rules based on their neighbors, creating cohesive groups, the same for wasps and bees with their swarms, ants with their nest, termites with their mounds.

In describing collective behaviors, emergence refers to how collective properties arise from the properties of parts, and how behavior at a larger scale arises from the detailed structure, actions, and relationships at a finer scale (Bar-Yam, 2011). [21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sd.2173)

At cosmic scale, gravity pulling together matter to form stars, galaxies, and larger structures like galaxy clusters and superclusters, is also an emergent phenomena from the underlying physic laws. Planetary system formation from accretion disks are also included.
[22](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/all-about-emergence) 

The extreme gravity and spacetime distortions around black holes are emergent properties arising from the immense concentration of mass and energy. While the individual particles within a black hole might behave according to known laws, the overall behavior of the black hole as a single entity is something entirely new. [23](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/news/all-about-emergence )

The complex interplay of nuclear reactions and nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, and astrophysical events leads to the emergence of the observed patterns of elements in the universe. [24](https://www.anl.gov/event/emergent-phenomena-in-nuclei-collectivity-and-clustering-from-first-principles) [25](https://radioactivity.eu.com/articles/phenomenon/nuclei_synthesis) [26](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/nucleosynthesis-universe-element-factory) [27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis) [28](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/type-ii-supernovae-elemental-formation)

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation can be viewed as an emergent phenomenon; is not emitted by a single source, but rather is the result of the universe's expansion and cooling, which allowed photons to decouple from matter and stream freely. 
[29](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cosmic_Microwave_Background_CMB_radiation) [30](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/research/topic/cosmic-microwave-background)

The CMB's slight temperature fluctuations, or anisotropies, acted as seeds for the formation of larger structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters. These fluctuations are a macroscopic property that arose from the early universe's conditions. 
[31](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/cmb-life-in-the-universe) [32](https://figshare.com/articles/preprint/Cosmic_Deconstruction_and_the_Emergence_of_Nothingness/28395356) [33](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/emergent-models-new-perspective-cmb)

Plasma behavior from collective interactions of charged particles. [34](https://www.quora.com/What-is-collective-behavior-in-plasma-What-is-the-intuitive-way-to-think-about-it) [35](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/physics-plasma-oscillations) 

Fractals themselves can be considered emergent phenomena. In this context, referring to the appearance of complex patterns or structures arising from simple interactions or rules. Fractals, with their self-similar patterns at different scales, often arise from iterative mathematical processes or natural growth patterns governed by simple rules. 
[36](https://www.quora.com/In-what-ways-do-fractals-play-a-role-in-the-emergence-of-emergent-phenomena-in-complex-systems) [37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07287-2)

Changing the scale again, the growth of a tree. The branching pattern, often fractal, emerges from the tree's need to maximize sunlight exposure. The tree doesn't "know" the final fractal structure, but simple rules of growth and resource allocation lead to this emergent pattern. Similarly, in Bacterial colonies, fractal patterns can spontaneously emerge during growth;  
[38](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130611084115.htm) 

While some fractals might be constructed through explicit mathematical equations, their presence in natural systems highlights their emergence from underlying processes. Therefore, fractals can be viewed as an example of how simple rules can give rise to complex, emergent phenomena. 
[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07287-2) [40](https://www.quora.com/In-what-ways-do-fractals-play-a-role-in-the-emergence-of-emergent-phenomena-in-complex-systems)

Mycelium, the network of fungal threads, exhibits emergent phenomena through its complex, interconnected structure and dynamic growth patterns. This network's ability to adapt and respond to its environment, including resource distribution and environmental changes, arises from the interplay of individual hyphae, making it a prime example of emergent behavior. 
[41](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0033-2017) [42](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/ges/common-mycelial-network-cmn-forests)

This mycelia network structure allows for efficient resource transport and communication across the colony or environment. The specific pattern of branching and interconnections is not predetermined but arises from the interactions of individual hyphae. 
[43](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569350v1.full) [44](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/ges/common-mycelial-network-cmn-forests) [45](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0033-2017)

Protein folding patterns from amino acid sequences can be considered an emergent phenomenon. This is because the final three-dimensional structure of a protein (its fold) arises from the complex interactions of its individual amino acids, and this folded structure has properties and functions that the individual amino acids (and the unfolded chain) do not. 
[46](https://condensedconcepts.blogspot.com/2024/11/emergence-and-protein-folding.html)
[47](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~ss44/bib/ss/nonstd/alife08b.pdf)

States of matter are emergent properties from the interaction of molecules.
[48](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1499-states-of-matter) [49](https://www.cif.iastate.edu/services/acide/xrd-tutorial/matter) [50](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-1-64327-292-4/chapter/bk978-1-64327-292-4ch9) [51](https://www.scienceworld.ca/resource/states-matter/)


## 6. Holistic and Systemic Thinking

The general definition of holism, as stated by the Merriam-Webster in the Online Dictionary, is “a theory that the universe and especially living nature is correctly seen in terms of interacting wholes (as of living organisms) that are more than the mere sum of elementary particles” [52](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/holism) [53](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-holism/)   

Holistic thinking is a way of understanding a situation or problem by considering all the interconnected parts and their relationships, rather than focusing on isolated elements.  [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9461385) [55](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ajss.20150401.02.html) [56](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-09015-004) [57](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/holistic-thinking)   

We can find connections and usually intertwined notions for Systemic and Systems Thinking. Those notions all converge to the idea that, for understanding a complex emergent phenomena, you need to also use the right cognitive perspective approaches, with the needed notions of creativity, explorative, flexibility and intellectual humility, similar to the Holistic approach. 

From classical western authors like Donella Meadows, Heinz von Foerster, Melanie Mitchell, Stuart Kauffman, James Gleick, Douglas Hofstadter, Erich Jantsch, Émile Durkheim, Gottlob Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Benedetto Croce, to many other ancient sages encountered across cultures and time horizons like Zeno of Citium, Epictetus, Ἡράκλειτος (Heraclitus), Παρμενίδης (Parmenides), Ἐμπεδοκλῆς (Empedocles), Περὶ Φύσεως Epicuro (Epicurus), 老子 Lǎozi (Laozi, Dao De Jing), 莊周 Zhuāng Zhōu (Zhuangzi), 刘安 Liú Ān (Huainanzi), 원효 Wonhyo, 道元 Dōgen (Shōbōgenzō), and this is only an exemplary list, have all contributed immensely to the ongoing research.

# Section II - Consciousness Studies

## 7.  The Architecture of Consciousness

### 7.1. The Foundation: The Dynamic Core Hypothesis DHC

The journey into Tononi's theories of consciousness begins with his collaboration with the late Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they jointly proposed the Dynamic Core Hypothesis. This theory posits that conscious experience is not the product of a single, localized brain area, but rather emerges from a distributed and constantly shifting assembly of neuronal groups within the thalamocortical system. [58](https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/)

The Dynamic Core Hypothesis emerged from a desire to move beyond simplistic localizationist views of brain function. At the time, much of neuroscience was focused on identifying specific brain regions responsible for particular functions. Edelman and Tononi argued that consciousness was a global property of the brain, characterized by two key features: differentiation and integration. Differentiation refers to the vast number of different conscious states we can experience, while integration refers to the unified and indivisible nature of each conscious moment. [59](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15522121/) 

Therefore, the phenomena being analyzed is a state of organization of a system amidst its own complexity, not a single entity in special; this resonates with the proposed definition of ASI as a state of decentralized coordination in chaotic systems, rather than a specific model deployment; concepts that intertwine themselves across scales.

The Dynamic Core Hypothesis can be seen as the conceptual forerunner to Integrated Information Theory. It laid the crucial groundwork by identifying integration and differentiation as the essential properties of a conscious system. However, the Dynamic Core was a qualitative and descriptive theory. It told us what to look for—a highly integrated and differentiated functional cluster—but it didn't provide a precise, mathematical way to measure these properties. This is the gap that ITT would later aim to fill.

### 7.2 Integrated Information Theory (ITT)

Building upon the conceptual framework of the Dynamic Core and informed by the biological insights from his sleep research, Tononi developed the Integrated Information Theory (ITT). First proposed in 2004 and refined in subsequent years, ITT is a fundamental and ambitious theory that aims to define what consciousness is, how to measure it, and what physical systems are capable of it.[60](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/integrated-information-theory/) [61](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory) 

The theory identifies five essential properties, or "axioms," of any conceivable conscious experience: [62](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19098144/) [63](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011465) 

**1. Composition**: Consciousness is structured, composed of multiple phenomenal distinctions. [64](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0167
)  

**2. Information**: Each conscious experience is specific and different from other possible experiences. [65](https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/) 

**3. Integration**: Consciousness is unified; you cannot separate the experience of seeing a red ball into the experience of red and the experience of a ball. [66](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/tononi/) 

**4. Exclusion**: A conscious experience is definite in its content and spatio-temporal grain, excluding other overlapping experiences. [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4014402/) 

**5. Intrinsicality**: Consciousness exists for itself, meaning it is inherently subjective and not dependent on an external observer. 
[68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10581496/) [69](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011465) 

From these axioms, ITT derives a set of "postulates" about the properties that a physical system must possess to be conscious. The central postulate is that a conscious system must have cause-effect power upon itself. This capacity for a system to be both influenced by its own past states and to influence its own future states is quantified by a measure called Φ (phi). A system with a Φ value greater than zero possesses some degree of consciousness. The higher the Φ, the more conscious the system.
[70](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Integrated_information_theory) 
[71](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15522121/) 

ITT can be seen as the mathematical formalization of the ideas first explored in the Dynamic Core Hypothesis. The concepts of differentiation and integration from the Dynamic Core are now given a precise, quantitative meaning within the framework of Φ. A system with high Φ is one that is both highly differentiated (has a large repertoire of possible cause-effect states) and highly integrated (this repertoire cannot be decomposed into the repertoires of its independent parts). The "main complex" in ITT, the set of elements with the maximum Φ in a system, is the direct mathematical descendant of the "dynamic core." [72](https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/) 

Furthermore, ITT provides a theoretical lens through which to interpret the findings of the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis. The fading of consciousness during deep sleep, as explained by SHY's synaptic renormalization, is predicted by ITT as a collapse of the brain's Φ value. The breakdown of information integration is not just a correlation of unconsciousness; according to ITT, it is the reason for the loss of conscious experience.

In essence, Tononi's three major theories form a tightly woven intellectual tapestry. The Dynamic Core Hypothesis provided the foundational concepts. The Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis offered a compelling biological case study of the link between the brain's physical state and the presence or absence of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory provides the overarching, mathematically rigorous framework that aims to explain it all, from the subjective feel of experience to the objective properties of the physical world that give it rise. Together, they represent a monumental effort to bridge the explanatory gap between the brain and the mind.

The Dynamic Core Hypothesis also offers an explanation for the difference between conscious and unconscious states. During dreamless sleep, anesthesia, or in certain pathological conditions like a coma, the brain's ability to form a large-scale, integrated, and differentiated dynamic core is diminished.[73](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256202268_Reentry_A_Key_Mechanism_for_Integration_of_Brain_Function) [74](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.20.444839v1.full) 

Studies using brain imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have provided evidence for this. In conscious states, the brain exhibits complex and widespread patterns of neural activity. In contrast, during unconsciousness, this activity becomes either more simplistic and synchronized (as in deep sleep) or more fragmented and localized (as in a seizure). [75](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/8360/brain-states-and-neural-mechanisms-of-consciousness/magazine) 

In essence, the emergence of the dynamic core is not a static event but a continuous process. It is the product of the brain's remarkable ability to flexibly integrate and differentiate information through the dynamic interplay of vast neuronal populations, primarily within the thalamocortical system. This ever-shifting coalition of neurons provides a compelling framework for understanding the neural basis of our rich and unified conscious world. [76](https://eyeofheaven.medium.com/dynamic-core-theory-a-theory-of-consciousness-ce2afac12c87) 

### 7.3 Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY)

The Biological Imperative: The Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY)

Parallel to his work on the nature of consciousness, Tononi, in collaboration with Chiara Cirelli, was deeply investigating the fundamental function of sleep. This research led to the formulation of the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis (SHY) in 2003. [77]( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16376591/) 

The question of why we sleep has long been a major puzzle in biology. Tononi and Cirelli proposed that sleep is the price we pay for brain plasticity—the ability of our brains to learn and adapt while we are awake. During wakefulness, learning and experience lead to a net increase in the strength and number of synaptic connections throughout the brain. According to SHY, this relentless potentiation is unsustainable. It consumes significant energy, saturates our capacity for further learning, and can lead to a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of neuronal communication. [78](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411729/)  

Sleep, particularly deep, slow-wave sleep, serves to renormalize these synaptic connections. It's a period of systematic, intelligent downscaling of synaptic strength, pruning away weaker connections and preserving the stronger, more salient ones. This process restores the brain's energetic balance, allows for the consolidation of important memories, and, crucially, prepares the brain to learn anew the next day. [79](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39163472/) 

The Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis provides a powerful biological context for Tononi's theories of consciousness. It offers a mechanistic explanation for why consciousness fades during deep sleep. According to SHY, the widespread synaptic downscaling during slow-wave sleep leads to a decrease in the complexity and connectivity of neuronal networks. This reduction in the brain's ability to process and integrate information aligns perfectly with the predictions of ITT.

If consciousness requires a high level of integrated information (a high Φ value, as we'll see), then the synaptic weakening described by SHY would naturally lead to a breakdown of this integration. The dynamic core would fragment, its capacity for differentiation and integration would diminish, and as a result, consciousness would fade. The return of vivid dreams during REM sleep, a state with brain activity patterns more similar to wakefulness, further supports this link, suggesting a restoration of a certain level of information integration. [80](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab023/6359982 )

### 7.4 The Consciousness delay-processing

As established, the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) elucidated that conscious experience arises from a highly integrated and differentiated state of information within a complex neural system—the so-called dynamic core —primarily involving re-entrant thalamocortical networks. Because the emergence of such a state depends on widespread causal interactions across distributed brain regions, it requires significant time (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) for informational integration to reach a level sufficient for conscious access. [81](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/40/10/1994) [82](https://iep.utm.edu/integrated-information-theory-of-consciousness/) [83](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-5-42) [84](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/integrated-information-theory) 

As a result, conscious perception necessarily lags behind initial sensory input and rapid, unconscious processing . This temporal delay implies that immediate behavioral responses—such as withdrawing from a potential threat like a snake—are typically initiated by fast, feedforward, non-conscious "zombie" subsystems (e.g., subcortical pathways involving the amygdala) before the full, integrated experience becomes available to awareness. [85](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-5-42) 

In this sense, consciousness does not drive reflexive actions but retrospectively integrates and contextualizes them , constructing a unified narrative of what has just occurred. This post-hoc synthesis supports learning, error correction, and future planning—functions that provide evolutionary advantage not through speed, but through depth of understanding. Thus, within IIT, consciousness is not an online controller of the present moment, but a "summary of the immediate past" , shaped by the metabolic and temporal constraints of achieving high Φ (integrated information). [86](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588)
